hh:mm:ss:mmm -->hh:mm:ss:mmm
00:00:05.000 -->00:00:19.000
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles

00:00:19.000 -->00:00:24.000
Same old tired, lonely place

00:00:24.000 -->00:00:29.000
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

00:00:29.000 -->00:00:34.000
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" 
*Cross the room your silhouette

00:00:34.000 -->00:00:39.000
Starts to make its way to me The playful conversation starts

00:00:39.000 -->00:00:44.000
Counter all your quick remarks Like passing miles in serey
