        <h3>Title:REVOLUTIONIZING HEALTH CARE SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY THROUGH BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <p> Healthcare supply chain involves a lot of complexity. It has a larger impact on human health. One of the major concerns in the current healthcare supply chain is drug counterfeiting. Supply chain management is an
            activity responsible for moving commodities and services from one point to another through a variety of
            stakeholders. The traditional SCM is based on a centralized approach managed at the central headquarter,
            and all other sub-offices get instructions from the main o ice. Some major issues with present supply chain
            management systems are security, transactional transparency, traceability, stakeholder involvement, product
            counterfeiting, additional delays, fraud, and instabilities. Therefore, it is very essential for the consumer to
            know whether the drug has come from the rightful source. So in such scenarios, a blockchain application can
            be used since it provides the features in such a way that a consumer can track and trace the drug in the supply
            chain with the help of smart contracts which provides an immutable history of transitions to all the
            stakeholders thereby eliminating the involvement of unauthorized people. It can also aid in transaction
            authorization and verification in the supply chain or payments without a third party. So here we described an
            Ethereum based decentralized Blockchain system with products anti-counterfeiting in such a way that
            manufacturers can use this system to provide genuine products without having to manage direct-operated
            stores, which can significantly reduce the cost of product quality assurance. Adding GIS to this proposed
            system can help to live track accurately.</p>
